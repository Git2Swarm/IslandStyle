# Island Style Wigs — Owner Direction & Build Strategy

## 1. Creative & Messaging Summary
- **Visual identity**: Elegant, flowing line-art silhouettes inspired by the provided reference images; rely on high contrast neutrals (black, white, soft metallics) with graceful curves echoed across icons, dividers, and backgrounds.

- **Audience needs**: Women facing autoimmune or medical hair loss who want private, judgment-free guidance, education, and ongoing partnership.
- **Experience promises**: Personalized consultations, expert coaching on wig selection and color matching, long-term care support (maintenance, adhesives, shipping help), and a nurturing community.
- **Key messaging cues**: "You are already beautiful; we're here to reveal it," hair transformation as healing, bravery and self-love, gratitude toward clients, selective placement of scripture/affirmations on storytelling pages.
- **Contact context**: Owner Sheri Blow; phone **605-660-9192**; awaiting confirmation of address/service location before publishing.
