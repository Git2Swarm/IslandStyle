## Visual Inspiration
The owner supplied two style reference images to inform logo treatments, line art, and general aesthetic. Keep them visible while working on brand explorations and early UI mocks.

## Messaging & Experience Highlights
Key takeaways from the owner briefing:

- **Voice & Tone**: Compassionate, faith-affirming, and confidence-restoring. Offer reassurance and practical expertise.
- **Audience Focus**: Women experiencing medical or autoimmune hair loss who need private, judgment-free guidance.
- **Core Promises**: Personalized consultations, color matching expertise, long-term wig care, and access to trusted resources.
- **Contact Details**: Sheri Blow · Phone **605-660-9192**. Address/service locations are still pending confirmation.
- **Faith Elements**: Sprinkle scripture or affirmations on select storytelling pages (e.g., About, Blog) rather than site-wide.

See the [owner summary](reference/owner-notes-summary.md) for the full creative brief, content blueprint, and phased implementation plan.

## Build Roadmap Snapshot
The implementation strategy follows nine phases:

1. **Project Setup** – Scaffold the project, tooling, and repository structure.
2. **Design System & Global Styles** – Establish color, type, layout tokens, and reusable UI patterns inspired by the reference art.
3. **Homepage Development** – Produce the hero experience, service highlights, testimonials placeholder, and call-to-action stack.
4. **Content Subpages** – Build About, Expert Help Hub, Hair & Wig Guides, Video Library, Shop Highlights, and Contact.
5. **Reusable Components** – Extract cards, navigation, CTA banners, testimonial slots, and media modules.
6. **Performance & Accessibility** – Optimize assets, ensure inclusive interaction, and verify contrast/readability.
7. **Content Management Integrations (Optional)** – Prepare for future CMS or structured content inputs.
8. **Testing & CI/CD** – Automate linting, unit/E2E coverage, and deployment pipelines.
9. **Launch Readiness** – Finalize copy, assets, metadata, analytics, and cross-device QA.

## Outstanding Inputs
- Confirm the physical address or service locations before publishing contact sections.
- Upload final testimonials when available so we can replace placeholders during the content polish phase.

Keep this README updated as new guidance or assets arrive so the project team always knows where to find the latest references.
